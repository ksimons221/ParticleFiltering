CS Particle Filtering

Hi all,

Here is my initial commit for the CS-188 assingment on Particle Filtering. If you want to and have a little time, try and complete the assingment, feed back is greatly appreicated. There may be a bug or two however I feel it is very closed to being finished. 

//////
If you want to reuse aspects of this assignment in you own work please do, I feel the most helpful/reusable aspect is the unFocusRouter function in which is checks if the answer is correct for almost every problem on the assignment. When I have more time I will clean up some of the code. Thanks

Please note, the working assignment is hosted live at:
